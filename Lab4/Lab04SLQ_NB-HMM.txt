Lab04: Naive Bayes
===================

Students must complete the code to create a Naive Bayes classifier for nominal features.
Also, they must analyze results based on tests in order to understand the effect of different hyper-parameters.

TOOLS:
------
Python, Jupyter, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy

I. Algorithms implementation
    I.1. Prior probability
    I.2. Multinomial Likelihood probability
    I.3. Model training
    I.4. Multinomial prediction
    I.5. Final product
II. Application and Analsis

    II.3. Naive Bayes performance

WHAT TO DO:
-----------
I. Algorithms implementation
    - Prior probability [8pts]
    - Multinomial Likelihood probability [8pts]
    - Prediction  [8pts]

II. Application and Analsis
    - Prior probability     [8pts = 2 + 4 + 2]
    - Smoothing [12pts = 2 + 4 + 2 + 4]
    - Naive Bayes performance [20pts = 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4]
